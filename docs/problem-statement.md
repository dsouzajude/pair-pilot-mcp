# Problem Statement: Interactive CLI Feedback for AI Agents

## 1. Overview

AI agents, such as large language models integrated into development environments (e.g., Cursor AI, Claude, Cline), often require human interaction to clarify ambiguities, seek feedback on plans, or request decisions during their operation. Relying solely on the primary prompt interface for these frequent, often minor, interactions can be inefficient, interrupt workflow, and potentially consume valuable (paid) tokens or context window space unnecessarily.

This document outlines the problem of enabling seamless, efficient, and user-friendly interaction between AI agents and human users, particularly when agents operate in constrained environments like devcontainers.

## 2. Key Challenges

- **Inefficient Feedback Loops:** Using the main chat/prompt interface of an AI agent for every small question (e.g., "Should I proceed with X?", "Choose option A or B") breaks the user's flow and can be cumbersome for quick confirmations or choices.
- **Cost and Context Limitations:** Frequent minor interactions via an agent's primary interface might lead to increased token consumption or prematurely fill up the context window, impacting the agent's ability to handle more complex parts of a task.
- **GUI-less Environments:** AI agents are increasingly run within devcontainers or other headless environments where traditional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for feedback are not available. Human interaction must, therefore, occur through Command Line Interfaces (CLIs).
- **Standardized Interaction:** A consistent mechanism is needed for various AI agents to request different types of input (free-form text, yes/no confirmations, multiple-choice selections) from a user.

## 3. Proposed Solution Requirements

To address these challenges, the proposed solution is to develop a **standalone Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** with the following characteristics:

- **Purpose:** Act as an intermediary for AI agents to pose questions to a human user and receive their responses.
- **Interaction Mode:** The human user interacts with the MCP server via a terminal-based Command Line Interface (CLI).
- **Agent Communication:** AI agents communicate with this MCP server over HTTP using [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse) as the transport protocol, as specified by MCP.
- **Question Types Supported:** The server must define MCP tools to support:
  - Free-form text input.
  - Yes/no (boolean) confirmations.
  - Multiple-choice selections from a list provided by the agent.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Language:** Python (version 3).
  - **MCP Framework:** `FastMCP` from the `mcp` Python SDK for simplified server creation and tool registration.
  - **CLI User Experience:**
    - `questionary` library for interactive and user-friendly input prompts (text, confirm, select).
    - `rich` library for enhanced terminal output (styled text, panels) to improve readability and presentation of agent questions and server messages.
- **Data Validation:** Tool input parameters (e.g., the question string, list of options) provided by the AI agent will be validated based on their Python type hints, leveraging Pydantic's principles as integrated within the `FastMCP` framework.
- **Deployment:** The MCP server must be packaged as a Docker container for easy deployment and execution, ensuring it can run independently of the AI agent's environment.
- **Standalone Server:** The MCP server runs as a separate process, allowing AI agents (potentially from different devcontainers or environments) to connect to it via a network address (e.g., `http://localhost:8100/sse`).

By implementing this MCP server, the goal is to provide a standardized, efficient, and user-friendly way for AI agents to obtain necessary human feedback in CLI-driven development workflows.
