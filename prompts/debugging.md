# Debugging Guidelines

- Step back and understand the code fully before assuming the cause of the error.
- Verify your assumptions by reading the actual logic in [src](../src/).
- Avoid hacks or guessworkâ€”focus on root causes.
- Ensure all tests pass before concluding. Use [README.md](../README.md) for high-level overview, implementation and test instructions.
- Keep iterating until the issue is truly resolved.
